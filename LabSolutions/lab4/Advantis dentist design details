Here is one approach to create a microservices architecture for the Advantis Dental Surgeries system:

**User Service**

- Manages user registration and profile management
- Implements API for CRUD operations on User, Patient, Dentist entities

**Appointment Service**

- Handles appointment booking workflow
- Implements APIs for appointment creation, retrieval, cancellation
- Integration with Notification service for emails

**Notification Service**

- Sends appointment emails and reminders
- API to send email notifications

**Billing Service**

- Generates bills for appointments
- Tracks payment status
- API for bill payment

**Surgery Center Service**

- Manages surgery center data
- API to create, update surgery centers

**API Gateway**

- Single entry point for all client requests
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices
- Handles authentication, security, rate limiting

**Service Registry**

- All services register here
- Enables service discovery between microservices

**Database**
- Stores all data for the system and each microservice CAN have its own database schema suitable for its needs

**Apache Kafka**
- Used for asynchronous communication between microservices
